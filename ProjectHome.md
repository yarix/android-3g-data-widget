# Introduction #
This widget will enable you to toggel 3G Data on/off in a single click.

# Why? #
**3G Data switch** as widget was created simply beacuse I couldn't find any other reliable widget that does the same for my old phone (**Android ver 2.2**). Most of the applications or widgets on the market didn't wokred well, or requested too many permissions.

# Download #
Take the apk from here: [3G Control 1.1.apk](http://code.google.com/p/android-3g-data-widget/downloads/detail?name=3G%20Control%201.1.apk)
